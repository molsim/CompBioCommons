* Name: MD_nucleosome_NAMD
* Version: 1.0
* Status: RAW
* Assosiated LE: 
* Parent LE name:
* Parent LE version: 
* Tags: MD, comp_biophys, NAMD, DNA, nucleosome

##Description
This live example provides a robust example of how to prepare, run and analyze molecular dynamics simulations of nucleosome core particle using NAMD. Examples of running on different supercomputers and batch systems are given.
##File structure
For details see [file_structure.md](file_structure.md)
* code - scripts to prepare, run and analyze simulations.
* libs - axillary libraries.
* input - input files.
* output - output files
* shared - force field files.
* SOFT - additional software to be installed.
* test-output - examples of desired output

##Prerequisitives
* Understanding of Molecular Dynamics theory.
* Linux and command line.
* Familiarity with HPC environment and job secheduling software.

##Software requirements
On workstation:
* Linux/Mac OS
* [VMD 1.9.1](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD)
* [NAMD v.2.9](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD) (optional)
