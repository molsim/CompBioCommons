It combines easily reusable \"live examples\" for solving various tasks in bioinformatics and comutational biophysics, lecture notes and useful toolkit scripts that help to automate common tasks. Lectures and live examples are further grouped into various courses aimed at training new computational biologists.\r\n\r\n[Live-Examples](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Live_Examples)\r\n-------------\r\nLive-Examples is a collection of reusable examples/tutorials for solving common problems in computational biophysics and bioinformatics. They are intended to serve both educational (like worked examples) and reference purposes (download-modify-reuse).\r\n\r\n[Lectures](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Lectures)\r\n------------\r\nA collections of lectures, cheet-sheet and reference materials on various applied topics in computational biophysics and bioinformatics as well as more general relevant theoretical and IT topics.\r\n\r\n[Toolkit](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Toolkit/)\r\n-------\r\nToolkit is a collection of small scripts and libraries, that help to automate common tasks in computational biology or facilitate interface with external programs. These are often used in \"live examples\".\r\n\r\n[Courses](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Courses/)\r\n------\r\nCourses are formed by grouping the \"live examples\" and lecture into a specific curriculum.","google":"UA-65207420-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
