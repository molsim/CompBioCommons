CompBioBase
=============
### http://molsim.github.io/CompBioBase/
CompBioBase is an online repository of reusable code examples for computational biology combined with tutorials and various learning materials.
CompBioBase if free for anyone to use, modify and contribute and is distributed under 

[Live-Examples](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Live_Examples)
-------------
Live-Examples is a collection of reusable examples/tutorials for solving common problems in computational biophysics and bioinformatics. They are intended to serve both educational (like worked examples) and reference purposes (download-modify-reuse).

[Materials](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Materials)
------------
A collections of learning materials that include lectures, cheet-sheets and other reference materials on various applied topics in computational biophysics and bioinformatics as well as more general relevant theoretical and IT topics.

[Toolkit](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Toolkit/)
-------
Toolkit is a collection of small scripts and libraries, that help to automate common tasks in computational biology or facilitate interface with external programs. These are often used in "live examples".

[Courses](https://github.com/molsim/CompBioBase/tree/master/Courses/)
------
Courses are formed by grouping the "live examples" and lecture into a specific curriculum.
