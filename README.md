CompBioBase
=============
CompBioBase is a learning and reference resource in the field of computational biology. It combines easily reusable "live examples" of solving various tasks in bioinformatics and comutational biophysics, lecture notes and useful toolkit scripts that help to automate common tasks. Lectures and live examples are grouped into several courses.

Live Examples
-------------


Lectures
------------
### General (Theoretical background/Topic overview)
### Bioinformatics
### Computational biophysics
### Information technology/Computer Science

Toolkit
-------
Toolkit is a collection of small scripts and libraries, that help to automate common tasks in computational biology or facilitate interface with external programs. These are often used in "live examples".

Courses
------
Courses are formed by grouping the "live examples" and lecture into a specific curriculum.
